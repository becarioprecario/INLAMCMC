# INLA within MCMC

Here I have included the R code used in the examples in paper 'Markov Chain
Monte Carlo with the Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation' by V. GÃ³mez-Rubio
and H. Rue.

The example are:

* linear

Linear regression on two covariates using a Gaussian likelihood and
simulated data.

* poisson

Linear regression on two covariates using a Poisson likelihood and
simulated data.

* lasso

Bayesian Lasso implementation.

* missing

Fitting models with missing covariates with INLA.

* spatialeco

Spatial econometrics models with INLA.

* mixture

Mixture models with INLA.
